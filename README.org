* Elescope

[[https://github.com/freesteph/elescope/raw/master/elescope-logo.png]]

** Overview

[[https://github.com/freesteph/elescope/raw/master/elescope-demo.gif]]

Most of programming lies in other people's code, and in
Emacs. Elescope brings you the best of both by allowing you to quickly
search and clone any project found on the supported forges (only
GitHub at the moment but contributions are welcome).

This package uses [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] and [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request][request]].

** Usage

1. Put this package somewhere familiar and load it;
2. ~customize-variable~ ~elescope-root-folder~ to tell Elescope
   where to clone;
3. ~elescope-checkout~.

** Configuration

*** ~elescope-root-folder~

Where to clone repos. No default set.

*** ~elescope-clone-depth~

How deep should the repos be cloned. Defaults to 1 so all clones are
shallow.

*** ~elescope-use-full-path~

If non-nil, use the full project path including username/organisation
to clone: cloning ~john/foo~ and ~john/bar~ results in:

 #+begin_src
└── <elescope_root_folder>
    └── john
        ├── bar
        └── foo
 #+end_src

as opposed to the default, flat hierarchy:

#+begin_src
└── <elescope_root_folder>
    ├── foo
    └── bar
#+end_src

*** ~elescope-github-token~

Token to use for identification on GitHub. This allows you to clone
private repos.

*** ~elescope-query-delay~

How long to wait before considering the minibuffer input a valid
query. This helps avoid firing a query for every single letter typed.
Defaults to 0.7 sec and can be set to any value understood by
`run-at-time'."
